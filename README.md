## Motivation

Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Macular Hole are leading causes of vision loss.  
Timely detection of retinal biomarkers such as drusen, subretinal/intraretinal fluid, and tissue defects is critical for diagnosis and treatment. Manual annotation of OCT scans is time-consuming and subjective, motivating the need for automated deep learningâ€“based segmentation.
